#### Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Dataset where target and the features both provided and model has to best fit these features to the target
2. Unsupervised Learning: Unlabeled/No target variables model has to group based on intuition into groups/clusters.
3. Semi-Supervised Learning: Hybrid of both have dataset is labelled rest is unlabeled.
4. Reinforcement Learning: Based on action a policy is evaluated and model is given a score based on the score the model keeps learning.

#### Terms:
- **Features** : Properties that describe the data (The parameter that are used in prediction)
- **Target** : The property to be predicted by the model
- **Classes/Labels** : In classification problems data has to be classified/binned into bins called classes.

> When a set of categories has some natural ordering we refer to it as ordinal .

> Dimensionality reduction: Coalesce many features into one without losing out on to much information.

> Modelâ€™s performance tends to decay slowly over time because the world continues to evolve while the model remains unchanged this is often called model rot or data drift.

> How fast they should adapt to changing data: this is called the learning rate

> Samples can be non-representative if the sampling method is flawed and called sampling bias.

> Feature selection selecting the most useful features to train on among

> Feature extraction (combining existing features to produce a more useful version)

> Model performs well on the training data, but it does not generalize well is called overfitting.

> The amount of regularization to apply during learning can be controlled by hyperparameter, a parameter of a learning algorithm
> (not of the model), not affected by learning algorithm itself and it must be set prior to training and remains constant during training.
