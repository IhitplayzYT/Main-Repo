# Call & Put Options:
---
### Call:
- CMP(Current market price of a asset) = 130
- Strike price(The price at which the seller guarentees to sell stock to you) = 100
- premium(Amount to give to seller to buy the call option, i.e guarentee that the person sell me stock for 100 ) = 10

Now if lets say MP(Market price latter on will be 80):
My balance:
-10 --> Premium i paid to buy the Call option
--*--
-10 -> Loss I got (if i exercised the option i would have to pay even more and sell cheap so i would have an even higher loss)


Now if lets say MP(Market price latter on will be 150):
My balance:
-10 --> Premium i paid to buy the Call option
-100 --> To buy stock from Call option seller
+150 --> Selling in stock market
--*--
+40-> Profit I made


Now if lets say MP(Market price latter on will be 100):
My balance:
-10 --> Premium i paid to buy the Call option
-100 } Can either buy and sell to gain no profit or not exercise it
+100 }
--*--
-10 -> Loss I will incur regardless of exercising.

## Put:
Like Call option but now the seller basically has to buy from me the stock at a strike price.

- If MP goes higher then or equal to strike price you incur of loss of premium, to reduce loss best not exercise the option.

- If MP drops lower then strike price then you profit from exercising option.
