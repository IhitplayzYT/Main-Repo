Procedural language
Six basic operators
◦ select: σ
◦ project: π
◦ union: U
◦ set difference: –
◦ Cartesian product: x
◦ rename: ρ

## PROJECT acts as SQL SELECT

σ<sub>p</sub>(r) : Selects tuples from r satisfying a equation p. p consists of ^,∨,¬,<,>,=,etc. 

- ALL OPERATORS ONLY DISPLAY DISTINCT VALUES AND AVOID REPETITIVE VALUES.

π<sub> a1,a2,... </sub>(r) : Selects attributes a1,a2,... from a relation.

- Most queries are a combination of π and σ.

⋈ - Natural Join : It is a Cartesian product + a condition
G - Denotes a aggregating function.
