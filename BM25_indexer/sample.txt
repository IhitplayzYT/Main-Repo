Natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence
that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.
In many practical applications, the goal is to extract useful
information from large collections of text.

When building search engines or document classification systems,
it is often necessary to preprocess the text before feeding it
into a machine learning model. This preprocessing step may include
tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and normalization.

Stop words are common words such as "the", "is", "and", or "to" that
appear very frequently in text but usually carry little semantic
meaning. Removing these words can reduce noise and improve the
performance of classical information retrieval techniques.

However, stop word removal is not always beneficial. In tasks like
sentiment analysis or question answering, words such as "not" or
"never" can be crucial for understanding the true meaning of a
sentence. Therefore, the choice of preprocessing techniques should
depend on the specific problem being solved.
