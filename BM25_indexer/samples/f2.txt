orks of Zhuang Zhou, which coined such word. Later scholars also provided a similar definition, such as Han dynasty historian Ban Gu, who categorized all the trivial stories and gossips collected by local government magistrates as "small talks".

Hồ Nguyên Trừng classified his memoir collection Nam Ông mộng lục as "small talks" clearly with the meaning of "trivial facts" rather than the Western definition of novel. Such classification also left a strong legacy in interpretations of the Western definition of “novel” at the time when Western literature was first introduced to East Asian countries. For example, Thanh Lãng and Nhất Linh classified the epic poems such as The Tale of Kiều as "novel", while Trần Chánh Chiếu emphasized the "belongs to the commoners", "trivial daily talks" aspect in one of his works.[25][26][27][28][29]

In Korea and Japan, very short stories [ko][30] stand out as a separate genre.[31] Depending on their length, Korean works in the genre of soseol can be divided into novels (Korean: 장편 소설; Hanja: 長篇小說; RR: jangpyeon soseol; MR: changp'yŏn sosŏl; lit. full-length novel),[32][33] novellas (Korean: 중편 소설; Hanja: 中篇小說; RR: jungpyeon soseol; MR: chungp'yŏn sosŏl; lit. midlength novel),[34] short stories (Korean: 단편 소설; Hanja: 短篇小說; RR: danpyeon soseol; MR: tanp'yŏn sosŏl; lit. short novel),[35][36] and very short stories (Korean: 콩트; RR: kongteu; MR: k'ongt'ŭ; from French conte [fr];[37][38] Korean: 장편 소설; Hanja: 掌篇小說; RR: jangpyeon soseol; MR: changp'yŏn sosŏl; lit. a novel the size of a palm of a hand;[39] or Korean: 엽편 소설; Hanja: 葉篇小說; RR: yeoppyeon soseol; MR: yŏpp'yŏn sosŏl; lit. a novel the size of a tree leaf[40]).[41]
Early novels

The earliest novels include classical Greek and Latin prose narratives from the first century BC to the second century AD, such as Chariton's Callirhoe (mid 1st century), which is "arguably the earliest surviving Western novel",[42] as well as Petronius' Satyricon, Lucian's True Story, Apuleius' The Golden Ass, and the anonymous Aesop Romance and Alexander Romance. These works were often influenced by oral traditions, such as storytelling and myth-making, and reflected the cultural, social, and political contexts of their time. Afterwards, their style was adapted in later Byzantine novels such as Hysimine and Hysimines by Eustathios Makrembolites[43] Narrative forms were also developed in Classical Sanskrit in India during the 5th through 8th centuries. Vasavadatta by Subandhu, Daśakumāracarita and Avantisundarīkathā by Daṇḍin, and Kadambari by Banabhatta are among notable works. These narrative forms were influenced by much older classical Sanskrit plays and Indian classical drama literature, as well as by oral traditions and religious texts.[44]
